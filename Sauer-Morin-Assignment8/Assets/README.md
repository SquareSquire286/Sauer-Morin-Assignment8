# Assets

With the exception of the assets found in the *Downloaded Assets* folder, all assets used in this project were created by us. I (Jacob) made most of the materials and constructed the virtual environment using Unity's built-in 3D object primitives, while Noe designed the models for the six appliances in Maya.
