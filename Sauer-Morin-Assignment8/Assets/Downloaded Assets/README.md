# Assets

**1. Oculus Integration:** This asset package provides support for Oculus VR hardware in a Unity project. Our project utilizes two prefabs: the OVR Camera Rig represents the player's avatar and tracking space, while the Local Avatar enables the user to see virtual hands at the tracked positions of the Oculus controllers. The asset package can be found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022

**2. Skybox Series Free:** This asset package provides several HDR skyboxes for Unity projects. One such skybox, called *Under The Sea*, is used in our project in order to influence the user into believing that they are in an underwater setting.
